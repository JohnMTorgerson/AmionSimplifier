# AmionSimplifier
Bookmarklet which scrapes amion.com and displays only the fields we want to see.

(This is not generalized for all of amion.comâ€”it's tailored to a specific account)

# Instructions
The user should navigate to http://JohnMTorgerson.github.io/AmionSimplifier/ and drag the button up to the bookmarks bar. That gives them the bookmarklet, which pulls the main javascript straight from the github repository.

The user can then navigate to amion.com, type in the password, and then click on the bookmarklet, which will scrape the page and reorganize the info for them.
